Subject Name : Java Programming
Project Name : Inventory Management System
Subject Code : 22412


1.0 Rationale:

 Inventory Management System can help to manage stock items. 
The system also analyses business inventory needs and can even 
automate orderly Inventory Management System are important for 
many industries including retail, food beverege, manufacturing, health 
care and more a well run system helps to understand and maximize 
potential, thus providing business operation and increasing profit.


2.0 Aims of Micro-Project:

 The main aim of the Java project on Inventory Management 
System is to manage the details of Customer, Supplier, Payment, 
Inventory, Purchasing.
 To build an application program to reduce the manual work for 
managing the receiving stock and payment.
 Provides the searching facilities based on various factors.
 Adding and Updating of records is improved which results in 
proper resource management of data.


3.0 Course Outcomes Addressed :

 Develop programs using Object Oriented methodology in Java.
 Develop Programs using multithreading.
 Apply concept of inheritance for code reusability.
 Implement Exception Handling.


4.0 Literature Review:

 We used the Java Complete Reference book for to gain 
information about packages, Multithreading and Exception Handling.
 It is also used to learn Interfaces concept in Java and to learn 
various classes in java.
 It also helps to get knowledge about the wrapper classes which 
converts primitive data types into object.


5.0 Actual Methodology Followed :

 We had communicated with group members.
 From above discussion we had decided topic name for preparing 
the project.
 We had planned the general structure of the whole project and 
collected information regarding project topic.
 After collected all information we had generated code for 
Inventory Management System.
 We had prepared a final report for our project.
